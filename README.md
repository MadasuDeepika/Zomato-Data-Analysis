An Analysis of Online Food Delivery Service: Zomato Restaurant data



Zomato, one of the largest players in the industry, uses demographic data to make intelligent predictions about what offerings might interest a particular user, then serves that customer ads for that item. It looks at relationships between variables like time of day, day of the week, and expected prep time of a food item at particular restaurants (along with other factors such as high-profile sports events and weather events) to predict the time a user will have to wait for their food.
Also use predictive analytics to plan how many drivers they will need for particular shifts and offer incentives when drivers are in demand, and they monitor customer satisfaction with particular items to estimate which food items are likely to be in high demand soon.



The dataset used for this project was found on an online public data platform called Kaggle.
